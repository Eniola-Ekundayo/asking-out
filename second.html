        <h3 id="love-message">Nneoma mi❤️, even i didn’t see this coming. Like I’ve said before, meeting you was one of the best gifts 2024 gave to me, October 24th to be precise and now we’re about to lock in an anniversary date that we’ll keep celebrating year after year(we’ll make sure of that). I’m just happy I got to express myself to you on time and let you in on my little mission (even tho you heavily doubted it) now guess who’s about to accomplish that mission?? I’m honestly speechless and at the time of creating this, I didn’t plan to, but I had to do it because obviously you’d expect me to ask you out when we meet but seems you just bagged yourself a boyfriend that’s full of surprises and enjoys being unpredictable by youuuuu. Love is easy and sweet with the right person and I’ll try my possible best to make it easy and sweet for you and for us both with words and actions because you deserve that and I trust you’d do the same. After the long while of calling you my babe(to-be), you have no idea how happy I am to finally call you ‘MY BABE’(because obviously you’re saying yes). I finally found someone I can be myself with (because she no too normal too), who makes me genuinely smile once I see her notification, her face and most importantly her pretty smile and who loves me, what more could I possibly ask for?…I could keep going on and on but I’ll reserve the rest for when we eventually meet and I’ll also finally get to hug you and have you around my arms. All this happened without us even laying eyes on each other physically and that’s crazy because I wasn’t one to do long distance before but here I am with my baby and I know that’s a good sign that this will be for the longest of time. You’ve told me what I need to do to keep you forever and there’s no way I’m changing towards you meaning this is forever (Gods grace abiding). Let me also add that you have yourself surrounded with good friends that actually have your best interest at heart from Ope(our biggest fan) to Tuvie and Shalewa (Walahi they’ll still kick you out of that room)and I’m also thankful to them for making this easier for us. Soo to finally be able to call you MY BABY, Nneoma…</h3>
